Continuous integration pipelines are the same for all micro services. They have been implemented thanks to an Azure pipeline template :
**_<https://github.com/ygo74/Inventory.API/blob/master/builds/pipelines/templates/service-build-ci.yaml>{:target="_blank"}_**

the pipeline provides the following features :

- Identify the build context (a.k.a Identify the build version)
- Build and unit tests the service
- Build the database script
- Store the built artefacts into the pipeline to be reused by the deployment pipeline

## Versioning

First tasks of pipeline have to identify the version number of the current build.

{: .warning-title }
> Versioning management process not yet finished
>
> Goal is to use semantic versioning and also ensure to create a unique version of build. This task shouldn't be under the developer responsibility.
>
> The versioning process is based on a git release flow and a custom Azure pipeline task has been created to implement the rules but it is not yet finished

## Service Build and unit tests

### Build service

- Setup dotnet environment

{% tabs setupDotnet %}

{% tab setupDotnet Azure-DevOps %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab setupDotnet Github %}

  source : https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet

  ``` yaml
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: 6.0.x

  ```


{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

- Dotnet build



  The build is done thanks to standard task **DotNetCoreCLI@2**. The version number comes from the versioning tasks

  The task needs the following arguments:

  - service's name
  - Dotnet project path
  - the variable's name which contains the version number

  {% raw %}

  ``` yaml
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: Build ${{ parameters.serviceName }}
    inputs:
      command: 'build'
      projects: '${{ parameters.projectPath }}'
      versioningScheme: byEnvVar
      versionEnvVar: 'CalculateNextVersion.NEW_VERSION'

  ```

  {% endraw %}

- Snyk security scan

  The security scan is done thanks the snyk task **SnykSecurityScan@1** retrieved from the **Snyk Security Scan** extension.

  the task needs the following arguments :

  - Service's name
  - Snyk organization's name
  - Test type
  - Test directory

  {% raw %}

  ``` yaml
  # Find the project directory from the csproj file path
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: Set project directory path
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Get project directory path
        $projectPath = "${{ parameters.projectPath }}"
        $directoryPath = Get-Item -Path $projectPath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Directory | Resolve-Path | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path
        echo "Project directory path : $directoryPath"
        echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=directoryPath]$directoryPath"

      failOnStderr: true
      pwsh: true

  # Scan service vulnerabilities
  - task: SnykSecurityScan@1
    inputs:
      serviceConnectionEndpoint: 'Snyk'
      testType:                  'app'
      severityThreshold:         'high'
      monitorWhen:               'always'
      failOnIssues:              true
      projectName:               '${{ parameters.serviceName }}'
      organization:              'ygo74'
      testDirectory:             '$(directoryPath)'
  ```

  {% endraw %}
